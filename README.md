### Why this project?

SciFinery actually, funnily enough, was born out of watching a YouTube video about the "Pillar of Autumn" from the Halo Franchise. For those who don't know, the Pillar of Autumn was the main hero ship in the game, and played a significant part in the story of the game.

The Pillar of Autumn was also [spoiler alert] the climax at the end of the game where its fusion reactors were detonated to destroy the Halo installation.

This was fascinating to me from an Engineering standpoint, where I questioned what kinds of chemical processes would be going on in order to produce an explosion on that scale. It got me thinking a lot about chemistry and how different chemical elements interact together. Originally, I was planning to make a simple Oil Refinery Tycoon/Simulator game where you run an Oil business and you need to build and upgrade your own oil refinery, using real refining processes such as "fracking" to separate various fuels.

I scaled this up and decided to make a fully-fledged Sci-fi-themed refinery simulator where players could run their own refinery and create any element they want whether it be a new type of fuel or a toxic substance that could be used in cleaning or military applications. The refinery construction part and element designer would be two separate games essentially, with the element designer being where the players spend the majority of their time.

So far, the Element Designer is the most developed - and it is actually kind of fun! Check out out below!
